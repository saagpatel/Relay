- Risks/notes:
  - No evidence of runtime regressions in frontend build path.

### REHYDRATION SUMMARY
- Current repo status: dirty, branch `work`, commit `444090a`
- What was completed:
  - Code delta + docs + screenshots.
- What is in progress:
  - Final verification and delivery packaging.
- Next 5 actions:
  1. Re-run `go test -race`.
  2. Re-run `pnpm build`.
  3. Re-run `cargo test` and log env warning.
  4. Commit with scoped message.
  5. Create PR body via make_pr tool.
- Verification status: YELLOW
- Known risks/blockers: local env missing glib for tauri tests.
